        <p class="text-formation">
          Princess Elizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926,[2] during
          the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father,
          Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son
          of the King. Her mother, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen
          Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the youngest daughter of Scottish
          aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne.
          Princess Elizabeth was delivered by Caesarean section at 17 Bruton
          Street in Mayfair, which was her grandfather Lord Strathmore's London
          home.[3] She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo
          Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29
          May,[4][a] and named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her
          paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary
          after her paternal grandmother.[6] Called "Lilibet" by her close
          family,[7] based on what she called herself at first,[8] she was
          cherished by her grandfather George V, whom she affectionately called
          "Grandpa England",[9] and her regular visits during his serious
          illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later
          biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[10]
          Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two
          princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother
          and their governess, Marion Crawford.[11] Lessons concentrated on
          history, language, literature, and music.[12] Crawford published a
          biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The
          Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[13]
          The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her
          orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[14] Others echoed
          such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was
          two as "a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness
          astonishing in an infant."[15] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described
          her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and
          well-behaved"

        <p class="text-formation">
          During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of
          succession to the British throne, behind her uncle Edward and her
          father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not
          expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to
          marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the
          line of succession.[17] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her
          uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the
          throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his
          proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a
          constitutional crisis.[18] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became
          king, taking the regnal name George VI. Since Elizabeth had no
          brothers, she became heir presumptive. If her parents had subsequently
          borne a son, he would have been heir apparent and above her in the
          line of succession, which was determined by the male-preference
          primogeniture in effect at the time.[19] Elizabeth received private
          tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of
          Eton College,[20] and learned French from a succession of
          native-speaking governesses.[21] A Girl Guides company, the 1st
          Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so she could
          socialise with girls her own age.[22] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea
          Ranger.[21] In 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United
          States. As in 1927, when they had toured Australia and New Zealand,
          Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought she was too
          young to undertake public tours.[23] She "looked tearful" as her
          parents departed.[24] They corresponded regularly,[24] and she and her
          parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.
